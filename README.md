                <h2 style="font-size:25px"> Effective Altruism </h2>
                <article><p style="border:5px solid pink"> Effective Altruism explores how someone may use their resources to be philanthropic in the most “effective”, productive, and worthy manner possible. Perhaps it is no longer sufficient to do one’s “best” to help others, one must rationalise one’s generosity.  
</br>
I am now an adult citizen, with that comes responsibility and opportunities I am attempting to grasp. Having left behind the obligation of full-time education, I have some choice over what to do in my life and/or contribute to society. I have thoroughly enjoyed volunteering as a receptionist, meals-shift worker and SWEP assistant at Jimmy’s Cambridge, the homeless night shelter due to its stimulating and important nature. I enjoyed serving meals at M&S, admittedly much less. In 3 days, I am travelling to Northern Uganda to volunteer on a livelihoods project to improve the youth employment uptake. Another act of service. But is this good enough? 
</br>
 Each person is drawn to certain causes. For me, I counted down the days to my 18th so that I could begin volunteering for a homeless charity. This interest stemmed from deep connection with a homeless man (/hero) Ian Yardley who I have known since I can remember. He was a good family friend. Thus, as with many, my charity engagement was affected by environmental factors.  
</br>
Even though I feel deeply inspired by VSO’s theory of change which integrally works towards the International Sustainable Development Goals by removing poverty through humanitarian social aid, I cannot help but feel guilty for polluting the planet by flying to and from Uganda. I could quite easily side with the argument that climate change is the paramount concern for Earth.  
</br>
Consider how to judge the effectiveness of an act of charity. Firstly, which cause is most deserving? Secondly, how is cause this to be supported in the most beneficial way? This is by no means simple. Unfortunately, this can come down to who deserves to live, or who to die in severe cases. 
</br>
 The new Effective altruism movement generally takes the approach that the greatest amount of good should be done to the greatest number with the least amount of money. Yet, should money be the basis of helping people? Perhaps, in this world of extreme poverty containing a huge wealth gap.  Perhaps not alone, in this world requiring humanity. Perhaps not in terms of sustainability and long-term improvement to peoples’ lives.  
</br>
Should the greatest number benefit? Or fewer in better quality? 
Does it matter more what my motivations are for a “charitable” act, or the outcome? 
</br>
Can we be altruistic, utterly selfless in any act?  
Can you even measure the effectiveness of charity? 
</br>
I have no answers. Or at least maybe a few, but as venerable Socrates said, “I accept that I know nothing.” 
</br>
I shall be keeping these questions in mind during my volunteering project in Uganda. I like to think that by doing this, I shall be able to do my “best”[imagine this with less ironic intonation] more effectively. I shall step closer to understanding what I believe effective altruism might, or might not, be.  
</br>
I hope that this article may encourage you to consider what effective altruism is or at least how you would like to be charitable, albeit affected by your bias in some form, of course.  
</br>
I intend to keep you updated on my exploration of effective charitable giving in Uganda! (And also my experience in general lol).

Today I am flying to Uganda to volunteer with VSO as part of a fruitful team. Our flight is at 8:30pm from Heathrow, and I shall arrive in Uganda the following day around 2:40pm. The project is focused on 6 of the international sustainable development goals (SDGS) and we are working to improve society through youth employment. Elaboration on VSO's project in Northern Uganda shall follow on another day. For now, I shall ruminate a bit about my current position and motivations for writing. 
</br>
For me, mental preparation has been paramount. I am going to spend the next 3 months in an environment which will overwhelm me, déstabilise a lot of what I think I know, and  remove my endless Cambridgesque (and Western) preconceptions. I've come to the conclusion that more than anything else I need humility and openness. I feel ready, and calmly excited.  
</br>
I've tried to think diligently about my priorities for this trip, what it means to be respectful, particularly culturally, how I can be as useful as possible in my international citizen service. 
</br>
I struggled with physical preparation also. Despite Having accepted that I would be living a (more) minimalist-lifestyle, I found it difficult to accept letting go of little pleasures that satisfy me. I will miss easy access to learning German, French and Spanish, unlimited books, pub trips, volunteering at Jimmy's, the good people I am fortunate to have in my life, talks and various one-off events held in Cambridge, and meditation at the Buddhist centre, for example. With a bit of rationalisation, I realise the next 3 months are valuable because I won't have all of this. 
</br>
I feel ready. Whatever that means. Except I don't feel too ready to share this blog due to my almost non-existent coding skills... Apologies for the aesthetics and malfunctionning.
